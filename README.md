`beepr2`: Even more Notification Sounds in R
========================================================

`beepr2` is an R package that contains one function, `beep()`, with one purpose: To make it easy to play notification sounds when running your R script. It is intended to be useful, for example, if you are running a long analysis in the background and want to know when it's ready. 

`beepr2` is an extended version of the original from <a href="/rasmusab/beepr">rasmusab/beepr</a> and all respects and kudos go out to him for making the original package as this is almost a 100% copy. The goal of this adjusted package is to expand the library with even more sounds, so you can even have a better time working with R. 

Also massive thanks to <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net">themushroomkingdom.net</a> for uploading all those amazing nostalgic sounds, which are super suitable triumphing the finishing of a heavy script. Cheers!
